# sicxe
Once upon a time in university, I was tasked with implementing an assembler for [SIC/XE assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Instructional_Computer).
Now I'm bored and terribly implementing that very same assembler that I never completed,
 but in [Rust, just to learn](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started). Because Rust is actually pretty cool. Also because I really want to finish this assembler 
 and develop something that can execute assembled sicxe programs.
